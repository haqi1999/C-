/*
------------------------ Enscapulation/Getter/Setter-----------------------------------
To Hide sensitive details in the "class" objects. This can be done by using the private 
command in the respective classes. 
    
There is a way to retun the private attributes outside the class blueprints. And that is
to use the Accessor Functions (Also known as getter). (Public function) 

The contrast of Accessor Functions is Mutator Functions (Also known as setter). Sets the 
value of the private member variable.

NB: Accessor methods should always have a return type that matches the type of the member 
variable theyâ€™re accessing.

Example of GETTER : Accessing the private time through public access specifier.
class Clock {
private:
  int time = 1200;

public:
  // Accessor function for time
  int getTime() {
    return time;
  }
};

int main() {
  Clock alarm;
  std::cout << alarm.getTime(); // Output: 1200
}

Example of SETTER :
class Clock {
private:
  int time = 1200;

public:
  // Accessor function for time
  int getTime() {
    return time;
  }

  // Mutator function for time
  void setTime(int new_time) {
    time = new_time;
  }
};

int main() {
  Clock alarm;
  alarm.setTime(930);
  std::cout << alarm.getTime(); // Output: 930
}
*/
